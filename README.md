# python_reading_writing


## INTRODUCTION

This project demonstrates how to read and write to a text file using Python. It opens a file, reads its contents, prints them to the console, writes a new line to the file, and then closes the file. This simple script serves as a useful introduction to working with text files in Python.

## OVERVIEW

The script begins by opening a text file using the open() function in Python's built-in io module. It then reads the contents of the file using the read() method and stores them in a variable called contenido. The script then prints the contents of the file to the console using the print() function.

Next, the script reopens the file, this time in write mode using the "w" flag. It then writes a new line of text to the file using the write() method and closes the file using the close() method. Finally, the script prints a success message to the console indicating that the new line has been written to the file.

Overall, this project serves as a useful introduction to working with text files in Python and demonstrates some of the basic file I/O operations available in the language.
